- 👋 Hi, I’m @sszaveljev
- 👀 I’m interested in drinking, smoking, hanging out in pubs, playing guitar, polluting environment by buying a lot of plastic, speeding up global warming, and causing collapse of civilization
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build wooden structures, welding, growing plants, electricity, machinery, etc. - everything that can be useful for the post-apocalypse
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on starting a nuclear war
- 📫 How to reach me: don't even try to reach me, i'm way beyong redemption 😈
